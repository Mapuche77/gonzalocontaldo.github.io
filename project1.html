        <h1 class="title">Little Weather App Project</h1>

        <img src="images/project.png">
        <h2 class="subtitle">Embarking on my first solo Python project</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I set out with a clear goal in mind: to dive headfirst into the world of programming and
            build something practical from scratch. The project took shape as a nifty little weather app, crafted using
            a blend of web scraping and Tkinter, Python's graphical user interface library. My aim was twofold: firstly,
            to apply the coding concepts I'd been learning and, secondly, to create a real-world tool that could fetch
            and display up-to-the-minute weather information at my fingertips. In the process, I struggled with data
            retrieval from websites, honed my problem-solving skills, and tried to make something similar to a
            user-friendly interface.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">What skills did I need to use?</h3>
        <ul class="skill-list">
            <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch data based on user input.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong> Using the ‘requests’ library to send an HTTP GET request to the API and
                retrieve weather data in JSON format</li>
            <li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> I worked with the ‘tkinter’ library to create the
                labels, buttons and frames to design the interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> I implemented a way of handling an error by checking the HTTP response
                status and displaying the error message if it failed.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> With all the information in the JSON file, I accessed and used just
                the ones I found important.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Formatting:</strong> For example in the temperature data by changing fahrenheit to celsius
                or managing time.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Handling:</strong> Used the ‘time’ module to get the current time and adjusted it based on
                the city’s time zone.</li>
            <li><strong>Layout Management:</strong> By organizing my GUI layout using grid and pack.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong> I structured the code using a class-based approach.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Code</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I set up a basic window configuration</li>
            <li>In this function firstly I created the URL for accessing the API to then do the web scraping. With the
                data I got as a response I asked for each piece of information required and gave them the proper format,
                For example; with the citytime I needed to divide the number the page gave me by 3600(1 hour expressed
                in seconds) and then add it to the base time. After that, I add the current time in minutes by accessing
                the index 4 of the gmtime tuple.
                Lastly, I created each label and set them so that I could use them outside of the function by using the
                benefits of working with classes</li>
            <li>In this function I defined how the user interface layout was going to look, I added some rows and
                columns to work with a grid format where on the first row I added the search bar functionality (which
                contains a label, entry and a button all inside a frame). Everything after it is just the information I
                got before being displayed so they are just labels with their proper font.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="subtitle">What would I do differently?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Well, if I were to start all over again, I would definitely structure the code in another
            way in order to make it more readable, maybe by separating it into different functions. Another thing I
            would like to improve is the design of the interface as I'm not satisfied with the result, maybe in my spare
            time I can dedicate some to doing so.</p>
